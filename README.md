## Nethackchar

### Description
Nethackchar is a project I created primarily for learning the Python programming language and gaining exposure to the Google Cloud Platform.  It accesses the Google NDB data store and is hosted on a Google App Engine instance.

The application's primary function is to allow a player of the game Nethack to keep track of their character's via an online worksheet.

Live demo of the application can be accessed at https://nethackchar.appspot.com.
